The goal of this project is to build a new functional website for the ACM Chapter at the University of Georgia. 

To get around the Universities limits on what technologies we can use, I am planning to make this in HTML/CSS/Javascript with the AngularJS framework. 

To future webmaster,

Here are several links I think you will find helpful:

https://egghead.io // for learning AngularJS 
http://css-tricks.com/ // for CSS... tricks 
http://nodeschool.io/ // Learn github, Javascript, node.js 

Also, be sure to minify your code.
